This chapter covered some of the basics of Python by discussing types of objects, basic expressions, and usage of the turtle.

An object is the one primitive element in Python. Objects are classified into different types. For types of numbers it has integer numbers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.

Primitive elements can be combined through expressions. For the number types above these take the form of mathermatical equations although the operators work a bit differently in Python.

319e5 represents the number 31900000.
